## About me

Brian Kimuma is a self-trained software developer. I graduated from Kenyatta University with a degree in Telecommunication and IT. I have a strong passion for software development and an understanding of several network infrastructures.

Most of the projects I had done, mostly after campus, were a part of online course I did in [edx](https://edx.org). I have worked with some of the industry experts in both Telecom and Dev worlds.
