## About me

Brian Kimuma is a self-trained software developer. I graduated from Kenyatta University with a degree in Telecommunication and IT. I have a strong passion for software development and an understanding of several network infrastructures.

Most of the projects I had done, mostly after campus, were a part of online course I did in [edx](https://edx.org). I have worked with some of the industry experts in both Telecom and Dev worlds.


## Projects

The following are some of the projects I have completed, sorted chronologically.


### IBM Project - onlinecourse website (September - 2023)

<summary></summary>
This is was a project by IBM after completion of two online courses:
1. [Introduction to Web Development with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:IBM+CAD101EN+3T2022/).
2. [Django Application Development with SQL and Databases](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:IBM+DB0211EN+3T2022/)

The learner was to build a website that would enable one enroll for online courses and upon completion of the course do examinations.
It involved working with Django -a popular web frame-work- for both the Front and Back-end Development. Majority of the work was in building the models, views and routing the html requests to render the relevant pages.
